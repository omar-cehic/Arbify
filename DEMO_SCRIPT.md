# 🎥 Arbify Demo Video Script (60 Seconds)

**Goal:** Prove this is a "Full Stack Product," not just a Python script.
**Tone:** Confident, fast-paced, professional. No "umms" or "uuhs."

---

### Phase 1: The "Hook" (0:00 - 0:10)
**Visual:** Start immediately on the **Dashboard** (already logged in). Do not show the Login screen (it's boring).
**Action:** Mouse over the "Live Markets" widget on the left.

> "Hi, I'm Omar. This is **Arbify**, a high-frequency sports arbitrage engine I built using FastAPI and React.
> Right now, you're looking at the **Mission Control Dashboard**, which monitors live data feeds from over 50 bookmakers in real-time."

---

### Phase 2: The "Core Logic" (0:10 - 0:35)
**Visual:** Click **"Find Opportunities"** (or Arbitrage tab).
**Action:** 
1. Quickly click a filter (e.g., "NBA" or "Spreads") to show UI responsiveness.
2. Click the **"Calculate"** button on a card with a good ROI (e.g., >2%).

> "The core engine processes thousands of odds updates per minute to find risk-free spreads.
> Here it identified a **[3.2%]** ROI opportunity between DraftKings and FanDuel.
> By clicking **Calculate**, the system automatically solves for the optimal stake distribution to guarantee profit regardless of the game's outcome."

---

### Phase 3: The "Full Stack" Proof (0:35 - 0:50)
**Visual:** Click the **"Save"** icon, then go to **Profile** -> **My Arbitrage**.
**Action:** Scroll through the saved history list.

> "I also built a full persistence layer. Users can save opportunities to track their performance over time.
> The backend handles secure data storage using **PostgreSQL** and **SQLAlchemy**, ensuring data integrity for every tracked bet."

---

### Phase 4: Outro (0:50 - 1:00)
**Visual:** Click **"Manage Account"** (or just stay on Profile). Briefly show the "Premium" badge.

> "Arbify is a complete SaaS production environment, featuring **JWT authentication**, **Stripe subscription management**, and role-based access control.
> Thanks for watching."

## 💡 Pro Tips for Recording
1.  **Zoom In**: Set your browser zoom to **110% or 125%**. Code text is hard to read on video.
2.  **Pre-load Data**: Make sure the "Arbitrage" tab has data loaded *before* you hit record, so you don't wait for a loading spinner.
3.  **Hide Bookmarks**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` to hide your browser bookmarks bar for a cleaner look.
4.  **Cursor Check**: Don't wiggle your mouse nervously. Move with purpose.
