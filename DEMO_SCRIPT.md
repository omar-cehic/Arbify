## 💡 Pro Tips for Recording
1.  **Zoom In**: Set your browser zoom to **110% or 125%**. Code text is hard to read on video.
2.  **Pre-load Data**: Make sure the "Arbitrage" tab has data loaded *before* you hit record, so you don't wait for a loading spinner.
3.  **Hide Bookmarks**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` to hide your browser bookmarks bar for a cleaner look.
4.  **Cursor Check**: Don't wiggle your mouse nervously. Move with purpose.
