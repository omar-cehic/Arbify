   - Odds that seem "too good to be true"

## 🎯 **Sample Verification:**

### **Opportunity: "Astros vs Mariners - 5.44% - UnknownvsBetMGM - player_batting_hits"**

**Verification Steps:**
1. Go to OddsChecker.com
2. Search "Astros vs Mariners"
3. Look for player hits props

6. **Conclusion**: Likely fake opportunity

## 💡 **Pro Tips:**

1. **Focus on major bookmakers**: DraftKings, FanDuel, BetMGM, Caesars
2. **Verify during live hours**: Some props only appear closer to game time
3. **Check multiple sources**: Don't rely on just one verification method
4. **Document patterns**: Keep track of which opportunities are real vs fake
5. **Start small**: When you turn 21, start with small bets to verify the system

## ⚠️ **Important Notes:**

- **Never bet money you can't afford to lose**
- **Odds change rapidly** - verify immediately before placing bets
- **Some props may not be available** at all bookmakers
- **Line shopping is normal** - slight odds differences are expected
- **Real arbitrage is rare** - expect most opportunities to be false positives initially
